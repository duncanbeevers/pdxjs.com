      %p
        I'm at the first Portland JavaScript Admirers, well attended, geeks
        cheering for CubeSpace. We've got lots of independent contractors, including my
        Hewlett-Packard friend from Pythoneers (how I'm logged in, wearing the fleece),
        whom I also invited to our Ruby meetings, first Tuesdays.
